## Abstract

## Motivation and Question

## Planned Deliverables

We are using the Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS). This dataset can be found on Zenodo at https://zenodo.org/records/1188976#.XrC7a5NKjOR. It contains 24 professional actors (12 male, 12 female) speaking identical phrases in calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, surprise, and disgust tone in a neutral North American accent. The data files exist in audio format and have naming conventions that described the tone that they are. The tones were rated 10 times by 247 other individuals and put into emotional categories.  
While the data set is much larger and contains video and song files, we will only be examining the audio data files
